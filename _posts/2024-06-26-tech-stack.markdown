The tech industry is an interesting place. It seems like every year or two there is an "industry changing" paradigm shift, and it creates a flutter of conversation, and chaos, and re-visiting of dogma, and on and on. Every major version of React seems to kick this off (or maybe that's recency-bias talking). It could be a new library, a new language, new framework, new build tool, or just new opinion from a taste-maker, and it shakes everything up. There are pro's and con's to everything in life, and in tech that's no different. What is interesting to me is that it seems like we spend an enormous amount of time re-polishing turds (or polished things) instead of actually building things that solve real problems. As an example, do we _really_ need to rewrite all of our React CRUD apps to use server components? Do we _really_ need to migrate all of our rails crud apps to elixir? do we _really_ need to write anything in java, ever? (sorry, not sorry).

Nothing makes me more angry than simple apps that are slow. Ok, plenty of things do, but whatever. The internet is full of tools we are forced to use because we are forced into it through some other decision we have made. Like, your bank's app probably sucks. Your solar system's monitoring app is nearly unusable. The US Military's websites and services are painful (or at least they were when I had to use them). Your local news station's website sucks, your TV's software sucks, your car's software sucks, look at Apple Maps launch, look at Spotify on a Tesla, look at _so many_ android tablets. Look at Apple calendar bugs. When is the last time you tried to print something reliably? Your video games require 60GB of data to be downloaded. The number of hoops I have to jump through between garbage services to pay money for my kids' school lunch is _insane_. First world problems? yes, I get it. But they're _also_ non-first-world problems, because if all of this stuff sucks on maxxed out Apple hardware, brand new iPhones, and gigabit internet, then how much worse is it for 99.9% of the rest of the world?

None, and I mean _none_ of your users care if your app is server rendered or client rendered. None of them care what language it's written in, none of them care what build tool, js library/framework/version you're using. All they (we) care about is: is it easy to use, fast (enough to not be painful), and secure enough with their (our) data.

I have my set of tech tools that I like to use, and plenty that I am ambivalent to at best, and downright hate at worst. But at the end of the day, maybe some of my favorite websites are powered by java! Maybe some of the worst things I have to deal with are written in Elixir! You can write good software in the "worst" stack, and terrible software in the "best" stack. And I think that you're super likely to write bad software in the "best" stack if you're constantly grasping at the latest and greatest shiny toys that tech influencers are sending your way. Their job is to evangelize new tech. If they say "nah just keep using the old solid stuff" then they don't really have anything to say. Look at [levelsio](https://x.com/levelsio) in twitter/x. He uses the same old stack for everything he makes. "Vanilla HTML, JS with jQuery, PHP and SQLite" - that's it. Finding a small set of tools that work for you, and using them nearly-exclusively, could very well just be the most efficient thing you can do with your time. How does that square with "always be learning"? I don't know. Just do whatever feels right. Let's just be nice to each other while we do it.

Cheers!
