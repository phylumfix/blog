Hello, 

For a long time I have wanted a place where I could write my thoughts down. I have a lot of thoughts. Sometimes I write them in a notebook, sometimes I word-vomit on my friends, most of the time I try to talk to my wife about them. I'm not always great at arranging my thoughts into a coherent structure, and that means I end up talking in circles. This is at best frustrating and at worst down-right obnoxious. So, if you've ever been on the receiving end of my rants, thanks and I'm sorry.

Maybe with the luxury of being able to edit my thoughts before they go out into the wild that will improve, but maybe not. 

I used to think that people who gave presentations or speeches or things like that could just do those things perfectly the first time. Like a tech conference talk. It never crossed my mind that people would actually practice that before-hand. Or maybe, that they could give the same conference talk more than once. That felt illegal. It wasn't until I started to watch stand-up comedy more, and listened to some comedians' podcasts that I learned that they are doing their set many, many times. They make adjustments. They edit, revise, learn, re-do, do terribly, learn, and try again. I used to think that an hour-long special was just one example of a comedian getting on stage and telling crazy jokes for an hour. How insane would that be though. 

Anyway, the same is true with writing. You can write and publish the same thing in multiple different form factors, and that's totally okay. Plenty of books start out as tweets, or articles, or blog posts that grow and morph into a book. What's great about that is if you read the early versions of something, and enjoyed it, then you get to later read a more improved version of the same thing. And if you didn't find the earliest versions of a piece of content, you get to jump in to the refined version. There's no wrong way.

There are a lot of "content creators" in the world today, but even more content consumers. I have been stuck in the trap of consuming content for a very long time, and while I used to learn a lot of things from the consumption (youtube, articles) - I recently recognized that I actually stopped learning. The learning turned into pure entertainment. Lately, I have been trying to re-gain control of my time, and spend it on things that are improving me. I have read actual books, fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is great for entertainment, nothing wrong with them at all. I have been reading a lot of non-fiction and trying to put into practice the things that I have learned. If an author is willing to put the time into writing a book about something that they learned that helped them in their life, and then that book goes on to sell to a lot of people, there's a _really_ good chance that there is at least some small nugget of wisdom or advice that I can get out of the book. Plus, supporting writers with dollars isn't a bad thing to do either.

So. Here I am, creating something. I'm also working on actually creating other things - some I hope to share about, some that I won't, it's anyone's guess which will be which. I have exactly zero intention of becoming a content creator by any means. I just keep feeling pulled to write down some things, so that's what I'm doing. Now, on to finding the publish button and it's time to work on the side-hustle.

Cheers!
